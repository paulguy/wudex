wudex - Fast, multi-platform WUD extractor
by paulguy
ported from VGMToolBox's NintendoWiiUOpticalDisc.cs by snakemeat

USAGE: wudex <WUD filename> <common key> <disc key> [output dir]

Key files are to contain binary AES 128 bit cipher keys (16 bytes).
If no output dir is specified, files are simply listed.

This program does not include keys, don't ask me where to find keys, 
they're easy enough to find on your own.
