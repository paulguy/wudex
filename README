wudex - Fast, multi-platform WUD extractor
by paulguy
ported from VGMToolBox's NintendoWiiUOpticalDisc.cs by snakemeat

USAGE: wudex <common key> <disc key> <filename.wud> [<filename.wud> ...] [output dir]

Key files are to contain binary AES 128 bit cipher keys (16 bytes).
Multiple wud files may be specified to allow for split WUDs.  Provide 
them in the order they are to be combined in.  The output directory 
argument is determined to be the first one to not end in .wud.  The 
extension can be in any letter case.  If no output dir is specified, 
files are simply listed.  Split WUD support is experimental and 
untested.

Any bug reports are welcome!

This program does not include keys, don't ask me where to find keys, 
they're easy enough to find on your own.
